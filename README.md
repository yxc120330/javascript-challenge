# javascript-challenge
js_hw is under js folder -> app.js (I tested in html this one should work and be able to filter the date as needed)

used the provided index.html, only added a scr script line to run the JQuery. 



hi Geoff
please help me look at app_d3_test.js for the code that I wasn't sure where the problems are. Thanks a lot for your help.
